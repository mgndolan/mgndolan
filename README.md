## Hi there, I'm Megan! 🌻

### A bit about me:

I started my career in biology originally wanting to study plant genetics in agriculture. I've always been a creative problem solver, but growing up in a small farm town, I was limited to the career options I was exposed to. It wasn't until college that I took my first coding class and fell in love. I couldn't quite move past the joy of implementing a tricky algorithm or the excitement from seeing a project spring to life with the click of an "Execute" button. Today, I am working as a software developer with the goal to constantly learn and grow.
